Max Consecutive Ones II

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most one 0.

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
        #index =  0 1 2 3 4 5
        #count =  1 2 3 4 3 4
        #maxcount 1 2 3 4 4 4 
        # k = 1
        firstZero = True
        
        maxCount = 0
        
        k = 0
        count = 0
        
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            
            count += 1
            if n == 0:     
                if firstZero:
                    #set this flag to True
                    firstZero = False
  
                else:
                    count = i - k
                # since this is a zero, set k to i
                k = i
            maxCount = max(maxCount, count)
        
        return maxCount
